## Project Description
The goal of “Is Your Microwave Running?” Is to create a fast paced, 3D platformer that is reasonably challenging and replayable.  For the purposes of the Capstone Project, my goal is to create a playable demo of some capacity.

## Current Progress and What's Left
As of Milestone 3 I've created a basic player model, rigged the skeleton, weighted the skin, created animations in the Unreal sequencer, and applied them in actual gameplay using a state machine.  This technically wasn't necessary to have a functional final product for the Capstone Project, but I felt that having some level of visual polish would make my game much more presentable, and having the placeholder capsule I was using sliding around with no animations wasn't going to make that cut.  The remaining work I have now is finishing the last of the player movement (most likely just adding the ability to do a dive and wall jumps), and creating a demo level.  On paper creating a level would probably be the more difficult of the two, but because I spent time in Milestone 2 creating repurposable obstacle Blueprints, that should help to expedite the process.
