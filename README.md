## Project Description
The game I am working on making is a 3D platformer where the goal is to complete each stage as quickly as possible.  I'll be using Unreal Engine 5 as an editor.

## Current Progress
The progress I've made so far is mainly creating a design document, which is used mainly to put ideas down on paper so that during development the game stays mostly in-line with the original concept.  Besides that I've also done some test work within the Unreal editor just to mess around with some basic ideas.
